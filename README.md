 ### **Project Overview:**

The following project entails building and simulating a drone-based delivery system where autonomous delivery bots of three kinds tansport
pizzas in a simulated arena. Each bot is assigned delivery contracts where pizzas and delivery destinations are placed at random, while the bots
gets contracts to navigate to pick ups and drop them off, while also handling charging and collection through its system logic.

The simulation lets us visualise autonomous bot decisions through its simple state logic and basic enviroment interaction all based in Python.
Throughout the project optimization will be made through learning and understanding the system design and making adjustments to bot decision makig to
improve optimization.
  
### **Task Based Solution Summary:**

**Task 1: Version Control**

Completed throug the use of GitHub and developing software engineering practices through activities including version control
to save multiple copies of previous work.

**Task 2: Bot Class Documentation**

Task was done by editing and completing DocStrings for each function in Bot() classes to get a better understanding of each function
and what its purpose is to aid with understanding upcoming tasks.

Software engineering practices were further developed by understanding and use of engineering conventions such as 'PEP 257 â€“ Docstring Conventions'

**Task 3: Data Analytics**

Folllwing task required to obtain bot data and present each of its KPIs, this was done for each bot and also for each bot kind.

The purpose of this task is to analyse how each bot kind perfomance data compares to each other and what bots strengths and weakness are.

Graphical and tabular data was presented with the use of matplotlib for data representation.

**Task 4: Performance Enhancements**

Objective 1: entailed adding varying charging thresholds for each bot kind as researched and determined by task 3 (data analytics)

Objective 2: to add more charging stations to a maximum of 4 to determine how has perfomance data has improved as bots require less distance to travel when
assigning the nearest charging stations to recharge

Objective 3: to add more pizzas to the arena where bots have additional pizzas to choose from and also adding a function that lets the bot choose the closest
pizza to pick up and deliver to maximise effieciency
